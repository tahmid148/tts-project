What profession has lost your respect over time?

For me, it is the police. I honestly used to believe they were mostly decent people trying to do a difficult job.

However, the sheer amount of scandals they have been involved in, and the lack of accountability make it clear that isn’t just a “few rotten apples”.

I myself have never got to the police about anything, before you say “I bet you would ring them in distress”.
